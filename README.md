# ♟️ Chess Performance Analysis – My Games from Chess.com  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes my personal chess games from [Chess.com](https://www.chess.com/) to uncover insights into my playing style, strengths, and areas for improvement. By treating chess games as a dataset, I demonstrate how data analysis and visualization techniques can transform raw gameplay into meaningful insights.

## 🔹 Objectives  
- Analyze win/loss/draw performance across openings  
- Track rating progression over time  
- Compare performance as White vs Black  
- Study results against different opponent rating ranges  
- Visualize accuracy and improvement trends  

---

## 🔹 Tools & Technologies  
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, `chess.pgn`  
- **SQL**: Querying structured chess data  
- **Data Source**: Chess.com API & PGN exports

## 🔹 Key Steps  
1. **Data Collection** – Extracted game records from Chess.com (PGN & JSON).  
2. **Data Wrangling** – Cleaned and structured data (date, opponent rating, opening, result, accuracy).  
3. **Analysis** – Explored performance metrics using Python and SQL.  
4. **Visualization** – Created dashboards with:  
   - Win rate by opening (bar chart)  
   - Rating progression over time (line chart)  
   - Heatmap of results vs opponent rating  
   - White vs Black performance comparison  
5. **Insights** – Identified best openings, rating improvement patterns, and performance gaps.

## 🔹 Sample Insights  
- Strongest opening: *Queen’s Gambit* – highest win rate.  
- Win rate with **White (65%)** is higher than with **Black (48%)**.  
- Rating increased by **+200 points in 6 months**, showing steady improvement.

## 🔹 Outcomes  
This project highlights my ability to:  
- Collect and clean real-world data  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Create interactive dashboards for storytelling  
- Translate raw data into actionable insights
